# The Kyma Chatbot Project

This repository contains some documentation about the Kyma Chatbot project. The Kyma Chatbot is a chatbot based on [SAP Conversational AI](https://cai.tools.sap/) (CAI) that can answer questions on Slack. It is self-learning from Stack Overflow and is updated based on a Kubernetes CronJob deployed in the Kyma runtime. The [SAP BTP, Kyma runtime](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/kyma-runtime?region=all) is a fully managed Kubernetes runtime based on the open-source project [Kyma](https://kyma-project.io/). The Chatbot is named Kyma Chatbot because it was developed for the Kyma Adoption team of SAP and can answer questions on the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime. However, it has been published on GitHub and can be adopted to answer questions about any topic.

## About Me and the Project
I am a vocational training student at SAP and the Technical University of Munich (TUM). I joined SAP in March 2021 and spent my first 6 months in the company with the Kyma Adoption team. They wanted to have a chatbot that could join the Slack channel the team uses for internal customer support. Therefore, I decided to do some research on chatbots and subsequently, I implemented the chatbot.

Feel free to reach out and give me some feedback about my blog article, the instructions on how to set up the bot, or the project in total. Thank you!
